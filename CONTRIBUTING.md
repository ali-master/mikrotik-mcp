# Contributing to `@usex/mikrotik-mcp`

Thanks for helping out! This is a Bun-native MCP server that exposes MikroTik
RouterOS as tools. This guide covers the layout and the one workflow that matters
most: **adding a tool**.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
bun run test:types     # tsc --noEmit
bun test               # offline smoke tests
bun run start          # serve from source (set MIKROTIK_* first)
```

Requires **Bun ≥ 1.3**. No device is needed for tests or type-checks.

## Project layout

```
src/
  cli.ts            entry point (serve / auth-check / tools / version)
  config.ts         env + flag parsing (MIKROTIK_*)
  server.ts         assembles the McpServer
  core/
    registry.ts     defineTool() + risk presets + registration
    connector.ts    the single choke point to the device (Safe Mode aware)
    routeros.ts     Cmd builder + injection-safe quoting helpers
    context.ts, runtime.ts
  ssh/
    client.ts       ssh2 wrapper (run / shell / decode)
    safe-mode.ts    persistent Ctrl+X session
  tools/            one module per RouterOS subsystem (the catalog)
    index.ts        moduleCatalog — the single source of truth
  prompts/          MCP prompt loader (reads ../prompts/*.md)
  transport/        stdio + Bun-native HTTP
scripts/            schema & doc generators
docs/               handwritten + generated reference
```

## Adding a tool

1. Find the right module in `src/tools/` (or add a new one and register it in
   `src/tools/index.ts`'s `moduleCatalog`).
2. Add a `defineTool({ ... })` entry. Use [`src/tools/vlan.ts`](src/tools/vlan.ts)
   as the canonical example:
   - `name` — snake_case, stable (clients depend on it).
   - `title` — short display label.
   - `description` — what the model reads to decide when to call it.
   - `annotations` — one of `READ` / `WRITE` / `WRITE_IDEMPOTENT` / `DESTRUCTIVE`
     / `DANGEROUS`. Pick honestly; clients gate on these.
   - `inputSchema` — a Zod shape; keep param names snake_case and add `.describe()`.
   - `handler(args, ctx)` — build the command with the `Cmd` builder (it quotes
     values, which is the injection boundary) and run it via
     `executeMikrotikCommand(cmd, ctx)`.
3. **Never** interpolate a user value into a command unquoted. Prefer `Cmd.set/.opt`;
   for `where`/`[find ...]` selectors, follow the existing quoted patterns.
4. Regenerate the generated artifacts and run the checks:

```bash
bun run gen           # schemas/ + docs/tools-reference.md (REQUIRED — CI fails if stale)
bun run lint
bun run test:types
bun test
```

`schemas/` and `docs/tools-reference.md` are generated from the tool definitions,
so a tool change must be followed by `bun run gen` and a commit of the result —
CI re-runs the generator and fails the build if anything would change.

## Adding a prompt

MCP prompts are guided workflows authored as Markdown in [`prompts/`](prompts/) —
no code change needed. Drop in a `name.md` file with frontmatter (`name`, `title`,
`description`, optional `arguments`) and a body that references arguments with
`{{placeholder}}`. The loader (`src/prompts/index.ts`) registers it on the next
start. See [`prompts/harden-router.md`](prompts/harden-router.md) for the shape.

## Conventions

- Logs go to **stderr** only (stdout is the stdio JSON-RPC channel). Use `ctx.info`
  / `ctx.error` inside handlers.
- Match the surrounding style: small, useful comments; no dead code.
- Keep tool descriptions accurate — they're the model's only guidance.

## Continuous integration

Every PR runs [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on Ubuntu and
macOS: `lint` → `test:types` → `test` → `build` → a generated-artifact drift
check. Run the same locally before pushing and you won't be surprised.

## Submitting

Open a PR using the [template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Make sure the
local checks above pass, describe the RouterOS commands your change runs, and say
how you verified them (device model + RouterOS version, or why no device was
needed). Be kind — this project follows a
[Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
